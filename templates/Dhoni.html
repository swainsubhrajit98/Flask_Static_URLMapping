        <p>Mahendra Singh Dhoni (/məˈheɪndrə ˈsɪŋ dhæˈnɪ/ (listen); born 7 July 1981), commonly known as MS Dhoni, is a
            former Indian cricketer and captain of the Indian national team in limited-overs formats from 2007 to 2017,
            and in Test cricket from 2008 to 2014. He is also the current captain of Chennai Super Kings in the Indian
            Premier League. Under his captaincy, India won the 2007 ICC World Twenty20, the 2011 Cricket World Cup, and
            the 2013 ICC Champions Trophy, the most by any captain. He also led India to victory in the 2010 and 2016
            Asia Cup. Additionally, under his leadership, India won the 2010 and 2011 ICC Test Mace. Dhoni is a
